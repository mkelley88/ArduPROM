ArduPROM
========

An (E)EPROM shield designed for reading and writing from the Arduino UNO. Currently it works with the pinout of a 27C512. 

I have designed this simple board and software to pull the contents of an EPROM or EEPROM chip over the USB serial line of the Ardunio UNO. I am currently using CoolTerm with the option of saving incoming data as a txt file. This seems to be a solution for now. If anyone out there would like to support this project and design a quick OSX, Linux, or Windows software to bring in the data and save it, that would be greatly helpful!
